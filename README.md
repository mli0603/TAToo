## Abstract
<img src="assets/tatoo.png" width="40"> (*T*racker for *A*natomy and *Too*l) jointly tracks the rigid 3D motion of the patient skull and surgical drill from stereo microscopic videos. 
<img src="assets/tatoo.png" width="40"> leverages low-level vision signals and estimates motion via an iterative optimization process in an end-to-end differentiable form. For robust tracking performance, <img src="assets/tatoo.png" width="40"> adopts a probabilistic formulation and enforces geometric constraints on the object level.
